I love healthy food options. I'd love some meat like salmon or chicken, but I'm open to other options too.
Please be very mindful, this is my meal bascially every day. It will be the defining factor in my health and physique.
As you know, diet is 80% of the battle when it comes to health and fitness.
And this *is* my diet, it'll eat anything you select for me.
So please, please, please make sure to give me the best option possible.
It will be the difference between me being healthy and in shape or not.

I've heard sweetgreen, Carrot express, and Rowdy Roosters have really healthy and great food.
I'm working to eat well and healthy. Think large protein-dense salads.
I'm a man who works out daily. I want to gain lots of muscle.
